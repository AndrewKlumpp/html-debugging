# Debugging HTML Practice

In this practice you will be debugging the provided HTML. There are a total
of 9 bugs to fix.

Your main focus is to practice identify and debug the HTML page. There are some
errors that are obvious while others take more attention.

## Phase 1: Debug the HTML

Once you have downloaded the starter, open the __index.html__ file in your
browser.

You will notice that the page is blank on your browsers. This is due to a bug
that you will have to identify and fix. Along with several other bugs that cause other elements to look out of place. Go through the code and use your knowledge
of HTML to fix the errors.

## Phase 2: HTML example

The fully debugged HTML page should look like the example below.

The example had a red colored "Text" between the two paragraphs. I don't think this is required for the HTML debugging exercise since we have not been introduced to CSS yet. It is most likely an artifact from app Academy converting the HTML file into a PNG file. I decided to research how to put it in my file anyways because I figured I would learn something from it. I learned that inline CSS is a great tool for changing styles when you don't want to link to a full CSS styles file.
